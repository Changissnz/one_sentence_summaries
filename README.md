# One Sentence Summaries

This folder, started on 7/5/2023, is dedicated to one sentence summaries personally written by me.

Sino history it is! I will go through the various dynasties in chronological order, and choose noteworthy topics
to write one-sentence summaries about. 

Go to `sino.txt` to see the summaries!
